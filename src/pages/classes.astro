				This is a "mommy and me" style class where the child is accompanied by a parent or guardian
				(just one). The two of you will do a medley of activities designed to help aid the
				development of motor skills and coordination. This includes simple dances, obstacle courses,
				and stretches. No equipment is needed but parents and children must wear socks.

				<strong>If your child is 2, they must turn 3 by December 31st.</strong> This class mixes tap
				for rhythm, ballet for poise, plus floor tumbling for body awareness and fun. This class can
				supply the basics needed to go into any type of dance and prepare children as young as 2 years
				old. Ballet and tap shoes will eventually be required as well as a leotard.
