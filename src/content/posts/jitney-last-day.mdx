Dear Jumpin' Jitney families, it is with a heavy heart that we have to announce the Jitney's last
day will be **September 1st**.

We have been agonizing over this for some time and have come to the realization that we can no longer keep up with both the dance studio/gym and the Jitney. The staff and I felt like we were not giving either business the love and attention they deserved.

Suzanne's staff will miss the fun times and little faces we had on the Jitney. We hope you and
your children have enjoyed your experience and guidance we have provided. I hope we gave them a
good introduction to sports, turning them into good athletes as well as good team players.

## Thank You For 30 Great Years!
